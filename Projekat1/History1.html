          <h4>
            <p style="text-align:left;">Chelsea was founded in 1905 by Gus Mears,an English businessman who had earlier bought the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the plan of transforming it into a football ground.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left;">His original idea was to rent it to an existing club,but after a deal with Fulham FC was halted,he got the idea to start a new club.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left;">Chelsea would quickly prove to be a hit with the local supporters and established itself as the biggest club in the capital. In the late 1910s, the club became the first in Britain with an average attendance over 40,000.</p>

            <p style="text-align:left;">The huge attendance numbers made "The Pensioners", a nickname for the team, to one of the richest clubs in the country and made it possible to pay well reputed players. Chelsea become also home for the first non-British player in the Football League, the Danish Nils Middelboe, who arrived to the club in 1913.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left;">Yet, the first five decades of the club's existence were not overly fruitful. The team would be in constant motion between Division 1 and Division 2. In their second decade of existence, however, they managed to reach the FA Cup final for the first time.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:left;">Their first League title in 1955 was a shock for everyone, especially considering the club had finished in the bottom half of the league for most of the previous seasons. This unexpected success was not enough to turn their fortunes around,however,and the club soon returned to mediocrity.</p>
                   <p style="text-align:left;">The mid-60s caught Chelsea at the height of their popularity, with many big-name celebrities becoming regular guests at Stamford Bridge. For the first time in their history, the club was seen as an actual contender. After securing their first League Cup in 1965, they followed it up with two more "firsts" by claiming an FA Cup in 1970 and a Cup Winners' Cup in 1971.</p>

                During the next couple of decades, Chelsea's on-field results were not much of a priority,as the club's officials were desperately fighting to avoid bankruptcy. The ownership of the Mears family was interrupted when the club was sold for the symbolic sum of £1 to the new owner Ken Bates in 1982.</h4>
